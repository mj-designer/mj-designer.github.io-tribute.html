                There is a science behind web design, the smooth and sleek display that users see throughtout internet exploring is 
                made with perfect percision. Some websites are made to sell a product, some are made to keep us addicted to constantly 
                scrolling and some are made for convenience. From the buttons a user clicks, to the forms filled out
                , it's all been catered to make the site convenient and appealing. It's like walking around in
                the real world, would you rather drive down a street with no trash and well paved roads or a street cluttered 
                in garbage and pot holes? If you tailor the design, you have a better chance at persuading the minds of your users,
                what they buy, what they see and how they view the content you display. Design is a huge piece of the world and
                an important piece to building websites.

            <p>
                Web design isn't always about selling a product, it can be appreciated and admired as an art. The amazing thing about art 
                is giving people the chance to interpret it. Imagine walking into a museum and viewing a painting 200 years old,
                the artist who painted this is unable to tell the story behind when they first put the brush to paper. This allows room for a new 
                interpretation. This type of interpretation is something web designers try to harness. Tools used today focus on the eyes of 
                the user and where they look the most. In turn patterns are shown to designers of how users are interpreting their content.
                If a designer is able to produce a site that a user sees as trustworthy and well thought out, then the art becomes
                something more than pixels and colors. If we, as a society stayed in place with web design from 30 years ago then
                the internet would be like the DMV, a place only visited when you're forced to go.
